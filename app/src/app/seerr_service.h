 * whether it is there. Off unless turned on in Innstillinger: then nothing
 * is ever sent to Seerr and the app is as it was.
 *
 * Kept in the Emby5 persistent data store: per Emby server whether Seerr
 * is on and its address; per account how it signs in and its session
 * cookie (as accounts.json keeps the Emby tokens); for the console,
 * whether it has Internet.
 *
 * Signing in needs nothing by default: Seerr starts a Quick Connect, the
 * Emby account in use approves it, and Seerr opens that user's session
 * (Seerr 3.4 and later). The Emby password or a local Seerr account
 * are the fallbacks. Everything runs on worker threads; the render thread
 * only reads snapshot().
