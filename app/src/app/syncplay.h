 * SyncPlay ("Se sammen"): watching in step with others through Emby.
 *
 * The server keeps a group with a play queue and tells every member what to
 * do and when: "unpause at 12:00:03.250 at 41:02". Emby5 joins or creates a
 * group, plays what the group's queue says (pausing until everyone is ready),
 * carries out the group's commands at the agreed moment (the server's clock,
 * measured against ours), and sends its own pause, play and seek to the group
 * instead of doing them alone. Messages arrive on the remote control socket
 * (app/remote); requests are Emby's /SyncPlay endpoints.
