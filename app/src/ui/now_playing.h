 * Music behind the menus: the now-playing page and the mini player.
 *
 * Music plays on the player's own thread without a picture (headless), so
 * the menus stay up. NowPlaying is the player's music screen drawn by the
 * app as a page: the same PlayerUi, fed the published status, its commands
 * sent to the player through app/remote (as a phone's would be). Circle
 * leaves the page and the music plays on; the mini player at the bottom of
 * the menus shows it, Options opens the page again.
